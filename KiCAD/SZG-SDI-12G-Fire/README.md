# SYZYGY 12G SDI Pod

This directory contains KiCad 7 design files for a SYZYGY 12G SDI Pod
intended to be used with the BeagleV-Fire SYZYGY connector and 12G
capable transceivers.

Near as I can tell, the SYZYGY Template PCB designs from Opal Kelly are
licensed under the SYZYGY Specification License Agreement (or at least
I was unable to find any other license information specifically related
to the PCB templates).  My changes to the template design are licensed
under the CERN CERN-OHL-P v2 (permissive) license to the extent this
does not conflict with the SYZYGY license agreement.

NOTE: Power rail separation for the SDI chips matches the Semtech Intel
FPGA Arria 10 Reference Design Daughter Card implementation vs. the
application circuit notes provided in the data sheets.
